# sonarr.email

A method of emailing everything that is on the calendar for a specific day.

This will also email you the status, Completed / Waiting.

Cron this for ~5pm when you're due home from work, and it will be a good indication + reminder that there's things to watch. Great for people like me who don't think about specific daily TV shows unless I'm prompted.
