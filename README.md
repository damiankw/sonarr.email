# sonarr.email

A little script to email everything that's on your calendar for the day it's ran (00:00-23:59), including the time it airs, whether or not it's already downloaded, the quality and original release name.

I have this on a cron for 5:00pm, so when I get home from work it's on my phone ready.

# Configuration

Just edit the email.php with your list of Sonarr's and API's
